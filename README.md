| Title | Remark |
|-------|--------|
| [Introduction to DSA](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Introduction-to-DSA) | What are data structures? What are algorithms? Why do we care? Learn with stories and real-life examples. |
| [How Computers Store and Organize Data](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Storage-Basics) | Discover how your computer keeps track of information â€” just like a toy box or a bookshelf. |
| [Big O Notation for Beginners](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Big-O-Notation) | Understand how to measure the speed of your code using simple graphs and pizza delivery examples. |
| [Arrays â€“ The Magic List](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Arrays) | Learn about arrays and how they let you keep your data in a neat line like toys on a shelf. |
| [Linked Lists â€“ The Chain of Friends](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Linked-Lists) | Discover how linked lists work like friends holding hands â€” one pointing to the next. |
| [Stacks â€“ Last In, First Out](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Stacks) | Imagine a stack of pancakes! Learn how only the top one can be removed first. |
| [Queues â€“ First In, First Out](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Queues) | Like a line at the ice cream shop â€” the first one to enter is the first one to leave. |
| [Hash Tables â€“ Super-Fast Lookup](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Hash-Tables) | Learn how to find things really fast using keys, just like finding your name in a contact book. |
| [Trees â€“ The Family Tree of Data](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Trees) | Discover how trees work like real family trees â€” with parents and children. |
| [Binary Trees â€“ Left, Right, Repeat](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Binary-Trees) | Learn how each node can have two children: one on the left, one on the right. |
| [Binary Search Trees (BST) â€“ Organized Trees](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/BST) | Make searching super quick using a tree where left is small, right is big. |
| [Tree Traversals â€“ Walking Through Trees](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Tree-Traversals) | Learn how to walk through a tree: In-order, Pre-order, Post-order. Easy and fun! |
| [Graphs â€“ Web of Connections](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Graphs) | Understand how things connect with each other, like cities on a map. |
| [Graph Traversal: BFS and DFS](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Graph-Traversal) | Learn two ways to explore graphs â€” one level at a time or deep dive! |
| [Sorting Algorithms â€“ Putting Things in Order](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Sorting-Algorithms) | Learn how to sort numbers or names like you sort cards or stickers. |
| [Bubble Sort â€“ The Slow but Simple Sorter](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Bubble-Sort) | Understand how to sort by swapping neighbors like bubbles rising. |
| [Selection Sort â€“ The Picker](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Selection-Sort) | Find the smallest number again and again and move it to the front. |
| [Insertion Sort â€“ One by One Organizer](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Insertion-Sort) | Insert each item into the right place like arranging cards in hand. |
| [Merge Sort â€“ Divide and Conquer](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Merge-Sort) | Split the list in halves and merge it back in order â€” like sorting puzzle pieces. |
| [Quick Sort â€“ The Smart Divider](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Quick-Sort) | Pick a pivot and sort around it. Fast and clever! |
| [Recursion â€“ When Functions Call Themselves](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Recursion) | Like a mirror looking into another mirror â€” functions that repeat themselves. |
| [Dynamic Programming â€“ Smart Reuse of Work](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Dynamic-Programming) | Save your answers and reuse them to solve problems faster. |
| [Greedy Algorithms â€“ One Good Choice at a Time](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Greedy-Algorithms) | Learn how to make the best local choice every step of the way. |
| [Backtracking â€“ Try, Try Again](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Backtracking) | Learn how to explore all paths and undo steps when needed â€” like solving a maze. |
| [Real-World DSA Examples](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Real-World-Examples) | See how DSA powers your favorite apps, from maps to messaging. |
| [DSA in Coding Interviews â€“ Practice Questions](https://github.com/potatoscript/dsa/wiki/Interview-DSA) | Master questions that interviewers love to ask â€” with step-by-step solutions. |
